I'm in front of collapsed site.
Six days have passed since the inferno and the area is completely silent.
This station in front of the park used to be a site for relaxation. It has since become tragic ruins. 
<Page2>
"............"
People used to come here and live their lives.
People completely unrelated to me, that I'd never so much as crossed paths with.
<Page3>
It's not the sort of thing where I can say I didn't know and move on. 
But I will say I didn't know and move on.
In the end, if you don't directly have a hand in it, you can just shelve all that guilt.
<Page4>
If ignorance is a sin, every man is be a sinner.
If insincerity is evil, then every man is be a villain.
That's why there's no reason for me to apologize for the scene before me. 
<Page5>
I'm not going to lament the deaths of people I've never met.
I'm wrong to mourn these people just because it's sad.
Farewells are moments of remembrance made for the living
These tears are probably a reminder of how brilliant that person was and a thank you for their great achievement.
It's because it's sad that my eyes are overflowing with tears. I'm selfishly apologizing just because it's sad. It's no more than a courtesy.
<Page6>
That's why―――I can turn my back on this scene.
Or I thought that I probably could.
<Page>7
"―――I'm an idiot, aren't I."
And yet, I can't stay away forever.
It's probably not my sadness. It's probably not a sense of justice either.
In realty for me it's probably just my own pitiful foundation.
<Page8>
And yet I still feel like this is wrong.
I can't just pull back the curtain because I've lost everything.
Someone told me long ago that you need to pull back the curtain with a sense of pride only after you've done everything you needed to.
It's nothing.
I feel that no no one had showed that to someone.
<Page9>
I hear footsteps behind me.
They're right there.
They were wearing my school's uniform, but I don't remember―――
<Page10>
That's right. Properly speaking, I don't remember them. The senpai whose name I don't even remember was standing up.
<Page11>
"Good afternoon. Are you also here to offer flowers to the deceased?"
"No, I'm―――"
Senpai doesn't break eye contact with me from in front of the barricade.
If I look, her flowers are swaying as if in memory of the dead.
<Page12>
"...I just came to see it for myself.
Even so, I only said half an aswer for that. In the end, I'm"
I can't avert my eyes from the world of vampires.
That vampire called Roa.
Her too. I just can't forget.
<Page13>
"As I thought, you're trouble aren't you."
Senpai's gaze doesn't turn in my direction.
I don't look at her either.
In this situation, I thought it was the police thing to do to someone who had come to give advice they didn't need to bother giving.
<Page14>
"Chasing after Roa and chasing after that woman.
Do you understand why you do those things?"
"Yes, I do. There's nothing I can do on my own anyways."
<Page15>
"...No, you don't understand, do you
Chasing that woman will only get you killed. You mustn't see Arcueid Brunestud any more."
"...And why is that?"
<Page16>
"Because once a True Ancestor loses to the movements of a vampire, it's already too late.
...Even a True Ancestor desires blood.
No, that's not quite right. In the first place, that desire to suck blood was transferred from a True Ancestor's to a human's.
Dead apostles are, after all, no more than just the ruins of what once was a human. Us humans call the genuine monsters, the True Ancestors, 'the first vampires'. To her, you're just a bloodbag turned collaborator.
<Page17>
"The first..? What do you mean..?"
<Page18>
"Please don't tell me you've never thought about it.
If humans turn into vampires by having a vampire suck their blood, there needs to have been some sort of first vampire.
We call this vampire for whom their existence springs from a different evolutionary tree, a True Ancestor.
They don't need human blood for survival, but are otherwise the same as Dead Apostles. No, they're creatures of much greater ability.
That woman is one of those Dead Apostles. She's royalty, you see.
...Though for them there's no such thing as birth right or social standing, so calling her 'royalty' isn't really right."
<Page19>
"――――――"
I'm a little bit lost for words at that explanation.
It surprised me, I guess.
It's so otherworldly that I opened my mouth. She really is a princess.
<Page20>
...Wow.
That dazzlingly airheaded, reckless princess isn't exactly what you'd see in a picture book.
<Page21>
"It's fine isn't it?
The guys you called True Ancestors are far from the sinful actions of the Dead Apostles.
They can get on just fine without drinking human blood.
But from birth they were given a single flaw...they have that unnecessary function.
It's just that blood-sucking impulse―――their disposition, the taste for human blood."
<Page22>
"In the past, if a True Ancestor attacked, there wasn't any humans who could oppose them. Then the person whose blood they sucked would be a human no more.
It's said that the cause is the sheer difference in our two species' ability, as well as the fact that they perceive blood as containing the soul."
<Page23>
"When a True Ancestor, an all-mighty being, steals blood, the person they stole it from ceases to be human. And to that violent 'other self' of the True Ancestor―――in layman's terms, you'd be just a doll.
...Even if...Even if that's not what the blood-sucking True Ancestor wants."
<Page24>
"I remember. If I've got it right, Dead Apostles 'turn' humans by sending their own blood into a person. On the other hand, 'True Ancestors' or whatever only need to suck a human's blood, right?" 
<Page25>
"Right. Thus, the problem is that there is no reason behind their compulsion to suck blood. Because there's no reason, they can't be stopped.
Those otherwise perfect lifeforms called True Ancestors have a baked-in fault.
Their 'sickness unto death', if you will. For their entire lives they need to suppress that impulse to suck blood"
<Page26>
"It's not just a matter of exercising self restraint through reason. Concretely, physically, it takes every drop of power they have to seal that desire away.
By self-inflicting their great powers, they're able to suppress their innate blood-sucking urges. However, if―――due to some external cause―――the True Ancestor's power was to deteriorate, they wouldn't be able to keep their impulses in check. Do you understand what I'm getting at?"
<Page27>
Deteriorated power due to some external cause...?
For example, using her power to heal a deep wound.
Once, even getting killed so thoroughly that any more and she wouldn't have been able to revive herself.
<Page28>
Arcueid is at a power level of 10.
Then, she she needs to use 7 points to exercise self-restraint around me.
However, if she lost 5 of her original levels and was down to 5 to begin with, and she was using those to not kill me,
then there'd be no power left. In fact, she'd be in the red.
What was she cutting down on in order to get the energy to regenerate―――?
<Page29>
"So then...If a True Ancestor was unable to contain that compulsion, what becomes of them?"
<Page30>
"Well, of course they'd suck blood. After that, there's nothing.
Once they succumb to that urge, it's just a downward spiral.
Once they know the taste of blood, the pain for a True Ancestor to avoid it becomes twice as bad. The result is that never again will they be able to suppress those urges."
<Page31>
"True Ancestors are of exceedingly fine stock, but for the purpose of suppressing those bloodsucking urges, they can never use their full strength.
However, a fallen True Ancestor has no need for such restraint.
Afterwards, they become a hedonistic monster which lives only to suck human blood."
<Page32>
The figure of Arcueid last night floats into my mind.
Her bloodshot eyes.
Her rough breathing.
That searing breath on the back of my neck.
<Page33>
"No, but that's―――"
That's an outright lie.
Because she's afraid of sucking blood, definitely―――
<Page34>
"―――ah."
Right, she's afraid.
She was so scared herself because she knew that once she sucked blood, there was no stopping.
<Page35>
"However, if there is one piece of reprieve, it's that the impulse is very sudden.
When True Ancestors are alone, they have servants prepared so that they can endure the rest of the time. That's where we get those creatures we call Dead Apostles.
They're the dead disciples of a True Ancestor. They're like living painkillers for them. Such is the beginning of those vampires we call Dead Apostles that have infested the city."
<Page36>
"But Arcueid Brunestud doesn't have any servants like that to use.
...Well, it's more that there wasn't a need until now.
For her, who was special even among Dead Apostles, she could suppress those urges just through force of will. However, she reached her limit last night."
<Page37>
"These impulses have no end, and they will never go away.
This constant suppression of urges creates sediment and before long, it overflows from its vessel."
<Page38>
"The longer they live, the stronger that urge grows.
And when their own power isn't enough to stop those urges anymore―――
When those urges exceed their own abilities, they follow the rules of their kind and end their own lives.
That's the lifespan of an infinite creature."
<Page39>
"........."
What the hell...
I feel like I'm gonna throw up blood keeping myself composed.
When they reach their limit, they're killed by thir companion's hand... That's what True Ancestors are.
